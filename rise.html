                        Oda Nobunaga was born on 23 June 1534 in Nagoya, Owari Province, and was the second son of Oda
                        Nobuhide, the head of the powerful Oda clan and a deputy shugo (military governor), and his wife
                        Tsuchida Gozen. Nobunaga is said to have been born in Nagoya Castle, the future seat of the
                        Owari Domain, although this is subject to debate. Nobunaga was given the childhood name of
                        Kippōshi (吉法師), and through his childhood and early teenage years became well-known for his
                        bizarre behavior, receiving the name of Owari no Ōutsuke (尾張の大うつけ, The Fool of Owari).Nobunaga
                        was a clear speaker with a strong presence about him, and was known to run around with other
                        youths from the area, without any regard to his own rank in society. With the introduction of
                        firearms into Japan he became known for his fondness for tanegashima guns.

                        In 1549, Nobuhide made peace with Saitō Dōsan by arranging a political marriage between his son
                        and heir Nobunaga, and Saitō Dōsan's daughter, Nōhime. Dōsan therefore became Nobunaga's
                        father-in-law.[2]

                        In 1551, Oda Nobuhide died unexpectedly. It has been said that Nobunaga acted outrageously
                        during
                        his funeral, throwing ceremonial incense at the altar.[3] Although Nobunaga was Nobuhide's
                        legitimate heir, a succession crisis occurred when some of the Oda clan opposed him. Nobunaga,
                        collecting about 1,000 men, suppressed the hostile members of his family and their allies.
                        However,
                        Imagawa Yoshimoto sent an army under the command of Imagawa Sessai. The army laid siege to Anjō
                        castle, where Oda Nobuhiro, the illegitimate son of Nobuhide and eldest brother of Nobunaga, was
                        living. Nobuhiro was trapped but was saved when Nobunaga handed over one of his hostages at
                        Honshōji
                        temple, nine-year-old Matsudaira Takechiyo – later known as Tokugawa Ieyasu - to make up for not
                        lifting the siege of Anjō. Later on, Nobuhiro plotted against Nobunaga with the assistance of
                        Saitō
                        Yoshitatsu, but Nobunaga forgave Nobuhiro after the plot failed. In early 1552, barely several
                        months after his father's death, one of Oda's senior retainers, Yamaguchi Noritsugu and his son
                        Yamaguchi Noriyoshi defected to the Imagawa clan. In response, Nobunaga attacked Noritsugu, but
                        was
                        repelled by Noriyoshi at Battle of Akatsuka; he retreated and left contested lands in eastern
                        Owari
                        under Imagawa control.

                        Oda Nobunaga fought many battles in his early years, eventually eliminating all opposition
                        within
                        the Oda clan and, with the destruction of Iwakura Castle in 1559, established uncontested rule
                        in Owari Province
