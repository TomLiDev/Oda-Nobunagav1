                        Oda Nobunaga was born on 23 June 1534 in Nagoya, Owari Province, and was the second son of Oda
                        Nobuhide,
                        the head of the
                        powerful Oda clan and a deputy shugo (military governor), and his wife Tsuchida Gozen.[1]
                        Nobunaga is
                        said to have been
                        born in Nagoya Castle, the future seat of the Owari Domain, although this is subject to debate.
                        Nobunaga
                        was given the
                        childhood name of Kippōshi (吉法師), and through his childhood and early teenage years became
                        well-known
                        for his bizarre
                        behavior, receiving the name of Owari no Ōutsuke (尾張の大うつけ, The Fool of Owari).[1] Nobunaga was a
                        clear
                        speaker with a
                        strong presence about him, and was known to run around with other youths from the area, without
                        any
                        regard to his own
                        rank in society. With the introduction of firearms into Japan he became known for his fondness
                        for
                        tanegashima
                        guns.[citation needed]

                        In 1549, Nobuhide made peace with Saitō Dōsan by arranging a political marriage between his son
                        and heir
                        Nobunaga, and
                        Saitō Dōsan's daughter, Nōhime. Dōsan therefore became Nobunaga's father-in-law.[2]

                    In 1551, Oda Nobuhide died unexpectedly. It has been said that Nobunaga acted outrageously during
                    his
                    funeral, throwing
                    ceremonial incense at the altar.[3] Although Nobunaga was Nobuhide's legitimate heir, a succession
                    crisis occurred when
                    some of the Oda clan opposed him. Nobunaga, collecting about 1,000 men, suppressed the hostile
                    members
                    of his family and
                    their allies. However, Imagawa Yoshimoto sent an army under the command of Imagawa Sessai. The army
                    laid
                    siege to Anjō
                    castle, where Oda Nobuhiro, the illegitimate son of Nobuhide and eldest brother of Nobunaga, was
                    living.
                    Nobuhiro was
                    trapped but was saved when Nobunaga handed over one of his hostages at Honshōji temple,
                    nine-year-old
                    Matsudaira
                    Takechiyo – later known as Tokugawa Ieyasu – to make up for not lifting the siege of Anjō. Later on,
                    Nobuhiro plotted
                    against Nobunaga with the assistance of Saitō Yoshitatsu, but Nobunaga forgave Nobuhiro after the
                    plot
                    failed.

                    In early 1552, barely several months after his father's death, one of Oda's senior retainers,
                    Yamaguchi
                    Noritsugu and
                    his son Yamaguchi Noriyoshi defected to the Imagawa clan. In response, Nobunaga attacked Noritsugu,
                    but
                    was repelled by
                    Noriyoshi at Battle of Akatsuka; he retreated and left contested lands in eastern Owari under
                    Imagawa
                    control.[4][5]
