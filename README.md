# Oda Nobunaga, Japans First Great Unifier

## Overview

This project was intended to provide engaging and useful information for audiences interested in learning about early Japanese history, feudal systems and the origins of the samurai by telling the story of Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga is a key figure in Japanese history and many of the most characteristic traits of Japanese culture have been influenced in some way by his life. The story of Nobunaga is historically important, but also provides context and understanding on the origins of many aspects of Japanese life and modern culture. His story itself is exciting and often brutal, with plenty of rich detail to draw on.

This website was intended to give a level of detail that would appeal to history enthusiasts, but also be presented in an accessible, easy to navigate fashion so that newcomers to the information would be drawn in and want to keep exploring and learning more.

## User Stories

### First Time Visitors

As a first time visitor I want to learn more about Oda Nobunaga to understand how and why he is important in Japanese history. I want the main facts about him presented clearly so I can decide if his story is one I want to learn about. I want to use the information to add to my own research on a specific element of Japanese history, or to understand Japanese culture more broadly.

### Return Visitor

As a return visitor I have taken on board some information on Nobunaga already and now want to find information on a particular influence/time/event in his life. I want to be able to navigate to this quickly and easily so I am not forced to re-read content and be presented with new information quickly.

### History Enthusiast User

As a user who is interested in history I want to be able to understand how Oda Nobunaga fits in with broader Japanese history whilst also be able to quickly understand timelines, phases and dates of specific events in line with the study of history. I also want access to deeper, richer historical detail on Nobunaga so I can determine for myself how important or unique he may be.

### Samurai/Military Enthusiast User

As a user who is interested in learning more about the samurai I want quick, easy access to this specific content so I can determine how/why Nobunaga is important in their story. I am less likely to readily engage with large sections of text so eye catching images/graphical content on the weaponry, tactics, battles etc of samurai will be needed to draw me in.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted a striking, eye catching colour scheme that drew the user in and made images stand out, whilst also providing good contrast between text/headers and backgrounds for easy navigation.

Many of the images I used for the project are digital copies of original Japanese artwork produced at the time, paintings on parchment and similar materials, which had a straw-like yellow/faded white colour to them. I used this colour as the background for many of the site pages, and it worked well blending the background images and giving contrast for headings and text. I also used the same colour for the font on the nav bar items, to provide consistency and I think it looks better here than plain white.

INSERT IMAGE

For the section on the homepage where Japanese characters are used I decided to keep the background pure white as this gave better contrast between the characters. It also helped to act as something of a page break from the hero image.

I toyed with the idea of using bold red text on the white, to match the Japanese flag, but felt this looked to garish.

### Typography

I used the INSERT FONT AND IMAGE

### Imagery

Fortunately there are a number of high quality historical images digitally reproduced from original Japanese artwork that I have used throughout the site. This includes images of Nobunaga himself, his military units, battles and castles. These images are impressive and also maintain the historical theme as users navigate the site. However I decided to use modern maps where relevant as the historical maps, whilst pretty, were difficuilt to read and I wanted to give a clear indication of territory/expansion as information. I specifically didn't want to use photos or modern-style representations of samurai as I feel this wouldn't have fit with the historical theme of the site.

## Features

### General Features On All pages

#### Header/Nav Bar

Every page has the same navigation bar at the top, comprising Oda Nobunaga (the name as it is) in the top left of the nav bar as an anchor back to the homepage. Immediatly to the right is a small image of the Oda house crest. To the right of the nav bar are Rise, Reign and Legacy links, which take the user to the relevant page.

INSERT IMAGE

#### Footer

Every page has the same footer bar comprising icon links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Linkedin.

### Homepage

On the homepage the user is presented with the hero image of Oda Nobunaga with a stap-line text section appearing in the top left as a very brief explanation of what the site is about. Below this are the 3 Japanese characters representing Rise, Reign and Legacy, showing the relevant years of these phases of Nobunaga's life and a brief text explanation of the time period. The character and time sub heading are wrapped in anchor which also links the user to the relevant page.

### Rise page

The rise page is comprised of 2 vertically seperate sections. The first details Nobunagas early life with an image of Ashigaru, a military unit he made famous. All text sections across the rise, reig and legacy pages are comprised of a title, sub title with a date(s) and the main text content itself.

The second section details the Unification of Owara. Below this is a map with a slowly-zooming in animation effect. This was chosen for 2 reasons, firstly I wanted to create the impression of how many other territories surrounded Nobunaga, and secondly with it at the bottom of the page I wanted to increase the chance the user would actually see it.

### Reign page

The reign page is comprised of 2 vertically seperate sections. The first gives details of Conquest beyond Owari, with a large, fantastically colourful image to the right, of one of the key battles.

Beneath this is a iframe element containing an embedded Youtube video on Japanese matchlock weapons. I wanted to incorporate media that was more dynamic than simple text and images and bring the technology of the day alive and more real.

Below this, above the footer, is the Unification of Japan section which gives further detail on Nobunagas campaigns and eventual conquest of the country. A large image of Azuchi castle is to the right of the text.

### Legacy page

The legacy page is comprised of 2 vertically seperate sections. The first is split with text on the left and an image on the right of Nobunagas betrayal and assasination.

Below this is the final content section detailing Nobunagas legacy and ongoing historical significance. In this section the map to the left of the text takes up half of the section and shows the total territoy eventually conquered by Nobunaga and his ally. I wanted this image ot be large, partly so the legend of the map is readable, but also to show clearly the extent of conquest from his starting point.
