# Oda Nobunaga, Japans First Great Unifier

## Overview

This project was intended to provide engaging and useful information for audiences interested in learning about early Japanese history, feudal systems and the origins of the samurai by telling the story of Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga is a key figure in Japanese history and many of the most characteristic traits of Japanese culture have been influenced in some way by his life. The story of Nobunaga is historically important, but also provides context and understanding on the origins of many aspects of Japanese life and modern culture. His story itself is exciting and often brutal, with plenty of rich detail to draw on.

This website was intended to give a level of detail that would appeal to history enthusiasts, but also be presented in an accessible, easy to navigate fashion so that newcomers to the information would be drawn in and want to keep exploring and learning more.

## User Stories

### First Time Visitors

As a first time visitor I want to learn more about Oda Nobunaga to understand how and why he is important in Japanese history. I want the main facts about him presented clearly so I can decide if his story is one I want to learn about. I want to use the information to add to my own research on a specific element of Japanese history, or to understand Japanese culture more broadly.

### Return Visitor

As a return visitor I have taken on board some information on Nobunaga already and now want to find information on a particular influence/time/event in his life. I want to be able to navigate to this quickly and easily so I am not forced to re-read content and be presented with new information quickly.

### History Enthusiast User

As a user who is interested in history I want to be able to understand how Oda Nobunaga fits in with broader Japanese history whilst also be able to quickly understand timelines, phases and dates of specific events in line with the study of history. I also want access to deeper, richer historical detail on Nobunaga so I can determine for myself how important or unique he may be.

### Samurai/Military Enthusiast User

As a user who is interested in learning more about the samurai I want quick, easy access to this specific content so I can determine how/why Nobunaga is important in their story. I am less likely to readily engage with large sections of text so eye catching images/graphical content on the weaponry, tactics, battles etc of samurai will be needed to draw me in.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted a striking, eye catching colour scheme that drew the user in and made images stand out, whilst also providing good contrast between text/headers and backgrounds for easy navigation.

Many of the images I used for the project are digital copies of original Japanese artwork produced at the time, paintings on parchment and similar materials, which had a straw-like yellow/faded white colour to them. I used this colour as the background for many of the site pages, and it worked well blending the background images and giving contrast for headings and text. I also used the same colour for the font on the nav bar items, to provide consistency and I think it looks better here than plain white.

INSERT IMAGE

For the section on the homepage where Japanese characters are used I decided to keep the background pure white as this gave better contrast between the characters. It also helped to act as something of a page break from the hero image.

I toyed with the idea of using bold red text on the white, to match the Japanese flag, but felt this looked to garish.

### Typography

I used the INSERT FONT AND IMAGE

### Imagery

Fortunately there are a number of high quality historical images digitally reproduced from original Japanese artwork that I have used throughout the site. This includes images of Nobunaga himself, his military units, battles and castles. These images are impressive and also maintain the historical theme as users navigate the site. However I decided to use modern maps where relevant as the historical maps, whilst pretty, were difficuilt to read and I wanted to give a clear indication of territory/expansion as information. I specifically didn't want to use photos or modern-style representations of samurai as I feel this wouldn't have fit with the historical theme of the site.
