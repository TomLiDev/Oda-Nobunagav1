                    Oda Nobunaga was attacked shortly after conquering his province of Owari. Imagawa Yoshimoto, a long
                    time oponent of Nobunagas father, gathered an army of 25,000 men and took the Washizu and Marune
                    Fortress in Owari territoy. Despite only having an army of some 3000 to respond with Nobunaga,
                    calmly ordered a counter attack and through clever ambush and deception killed Yoshimoto and
                    defeated his army at the Battle of Okehazama. This victory increased Nobunagas prestige greatly and
                    drew many more samurai and warlords to him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With his growing fame Nobunaga was able to convince many commanders and generals in rival clans to
                    defect to him, weaking his enemies and contributing to his victory in the Mino campaign of 1561 -
                    1567. This secured Nobunaga an entirely new province, castles, land and retainers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The following Ise and Omi campaigns secured Nobunaga yet more territory. As a result, in 1568
                    Ashikaga Yoshiaki, the brother of the murdered shogun Yoshiteru, asked Nobunaga to begin a campaign
                    against Kyoto, Japans capital and otherthrow the puppet shogun. Nobunaga agreed and thus took the
                    first step in unifying central Japan.
