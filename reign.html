                        <p>
                            Oda Nobunaga was attacked shortly after conquering his province of Owari. Imagawa Yoshimoto,
                            a long time oponent of Nobunagas father, gathered an army of 25,000 men and took the Washizu
                            and Marune Fortress in Owari territoy. Despite only having an army of some 3000 to respond
                            with Nobunaga, calmly ordered a counter attack and through clever ambush and deception
                            killed Yoshimoto and defeated his army at the Battle of Okehazama. This victory increased
                            Nobunagas prestige greatly and drew many more samurai and warlords to him.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            With his growing fame Nobunaga was able to convince many commanders and generals in rival
                            clans to defect to him, weaking his enemies and contributing to his victory in the Mino
                            campaign of 1561 - 1567. This secured Nobunaga an entirely new province, castles, land and
                            retainers.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The following Ise and Omi campaigns secured Nobunaga yet more territory. As a result, in
                            1568 Ashikaga Yoshiaki, the brother of the murdered shogun Yoshiteru, asked Nobunaga to
                            begin a
                            campaign against Kyoto, Japans capital and otherthrow the puppet shogun. Nobunaga agreed and
                            thus took the first step in unifying central Japan.

                    <p>
                        After installing Yoshiaki as shogun, Nobunaga had evidently pressed Yoshiaki to request all the
                        local daimyō to come to
                        Kyoto and attend a certain banquet. Asakura Yoshikage, head of the Asakura clan and regent of
                        Ashikaga Yoshiaki,
                        refused, an act Nobunaga declared disloyal to both the shogun and the emperor. With this pretext
                        well in hand, Nobunaga
                        raised an army and marched on Echizen. In early 1570, Nobunaga launched a campaign into the
                        Asakura clan's
                        domain and besieged Kanagasaki Castle. This action made a conflict between Nobunaga and shogun
                        Ashikaga Yoshiaki, as
                        their relationship grew difficult, Yoshiaki secretly started an "anti-Nobunaga alliance",
                        conspiring with other daimyō
                        to get rid of Nobunaga. Azai Nagamasa, to whom Nobunaga's sister Oichi was married, broke the
                        alliance with the Oda clan
                        to honor the Azai-Asakura alliance, which had lasted for generations. With the help of the
                        Rokkaku clan, Miyoshi clan,
                        and the Ikkō-ikki, the anti-Nobunaga alliance sprang into full force, taking a heavy toll on the
                        Oda clan.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The "anti-Nobunaga alliance" continued to operate and draw allies against Oda Nobunaga. This
                        would result in some of the bloodiest fighting ever seen in feudal
                        Japan. Over the next 14 years Nobunaga campaigned, depending existing territory and conquered
                        new territory. In 1578 the Imperial Court, following a string of court appointments to placate
                        Nobunaga, granted him the title of Grand Minister of State, the highest post that could be
                        given. In 1579 the construction of Azuchi castle was completed. Nobunaga built this castle in
                        its strategic location close to Kyoto, so that he guard the approaches to the capital city.
                        Nobunaga is known for having great respect for the emperor and publicly expressed his support
                        for the Imperial system, however historians also believe that the construction of Azuchi castle,
                        with its proximity to Kyoto, was a statement by Nobunaga. He provided the defense, but he also
                        held the real power and control of Japan and was in many ways its de facto ruler.
