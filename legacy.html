                        By 1582 Oda Nobunaga was at the height of his power and essentially the ruler of Japan. One of
                        Nobunagas last remaining enemies, the Mori clan, were at threat of losing Takamatsu Castle, a
                        vital stronghold to the Mori which would have led the way to capturing the provincial capital.
                        Hashiba Hideyoshi, Nobunaga's general laying siege to the castle, requested reinforcements to
                        take the castle. Nobunaga ordered several of his leading generals to prepare their armies which
                        he himself would lead. Nobunaga left Azuchi castle to head his army, but on the way he would
                        hold a tea ceremony at Honno-ji temple.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At the temple Nobunaga was ambushed by Akechi Mitsuhide who had decided to assasinate him for
                        unknown reasons. Nobunaga and his 30 guards were quickly overrun and Nobunaga retreated to one
                        of the inner rooms to commit seppuke, ritual sacrifice. Mori Ranmaru, Nobunagas last remaining
                        guard, set fire to the temple whilst still inside, in accordance with his masters last orders,
                        so that his body could not be decapitated by his enemies. However Nobunagas body was never
                        recovered, a fact which still draws discussion from historians today.

                        Nobunaga was succeeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of Nobunagas greatest generals. Hideyoshi
                        would go on to pacify and maintain control of the Oda territory and eventually expand this
                        territory, further creating a single, central Japan. Toyotomi Hideyoshi is known as the second
                        great unifier of Japan.

                        After installing Yoshiaki as shogun, Nobunaga had evidently pressed Yoshiaki to request all the
                        local daimyō to come to
                        Kyoto and attend a certain banquet. Asakura Yoshikage, head of the Asakura clan and regent of
                        Ashikaga Yoshiaki,
                        refused, an act Nobunaga declared disloyal to both the shogun and the emperor. With this pretext
                        well in hand, Nobunaga
                        raised an army and marched on Echizen. In early 1570, Nobunaga launched a campaign into the
                        Asakura clan's
                        domain and besieged Kanagasaki Castle. This action made a conflict between Nobunaga and shogun
                        Ashikaga Yoshiaki, as
                        their relationship grew difficult, Yoshiaki secretly started an "anti-Nobunaga alliance",
                        conspiring with other daimyō
                        to get rid of Nobunaga. Azai Nagamasa, to whom Nobunaga's sister Oichi was married, broke the
                        alliance with the Oda clan
                        to honor the Azai-Asakura alliance, which had lasted for generations. With the help of the
                        Rokkaku clan, Miyoshi clan,
                        and the Ikkō-ikki, the anti-Nobunaga alliance sprang into full force, taking a heavy toll on the
                        Oda clan.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The "anti-Nobunaga alliance" continued to operate and draw allies against Oda Nobunaga. This
                        would result in some of the bloodiest fighting ever seen in feudal
                        Japan. Over the next 14 years Nobunaga campaigned, depending existing territory and conquered
                        new territory. In 1578 the Imperial Court, following a string of court appointments to placate
                        Nobunaga, granted him the title of Grand Minister of State, the highest post that could be
                        given. In 1579 the construction of Azuchi castle was completed. Nobunaga built this castle in
                        its strategic location close to Kyoto, so that he guard the approaches to the capital city.
                        Nobunaga is known for having great respect for the emperor and publicly expressed his support
                        for the Imperial system, however historians also believe that the construction of Azuchi castle,
                        with its proximity to Kyoto, was a statement by Nobunaga. He provided the defense, but he also
                        held the real power and control of Japan and was in many ways its de facto ruler.
