                            21st June 1582

                        By 1582 Oda Nobunaga was at the height of his power and essentially the ruler of Japan. One of
                        Nobunagas last remaining enemies, the Mori clan, were at threat of losing Takamatsu Castle, a
                        vital stronghold to the Mori which would have led the way to capturing the provincial capital.
                        Hashiba Hideyoshi, Nobunaga's general laying siege to the castle, requested reinforcements to
                        take the castle. Nobunaga ordered several of his leading generals to prepare their armies which
                        he himself would lead. Nobunaga left Azuchi castle to head his army, but on the way he would
                        hold a tea ceremony at Honno-ji temple.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At the temple Nobunaga was ambushed by Akechi Mitsuhide who had decided to assasinate him for
                        unknown reasons. Nobunaga and his 30 guards were quickly overrun and Nobunaga retreated to one
                        of the inner rooms to commit seppuke, ritual sacrifice. Mori Ranmaru, Nobunagas last remaining
                        guard, set fire to the temple whilst still inside, in accordance with his masters last orders,
                        so that his body could not be decapitated by his enemies. However Nobunagas body was never
                        recovered, a fact which still draws discussion from historians today.

                        Nobunaga was succeeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of Nobunagas greatest generals. Hideyoshi
                        would go on to pacify and maintain control of the Oda territory and eventually expand this
                        territory, further creating a single, central Japan. Toyotomi Hideyoshi is known as the second
                        great unifier of Japan.

                        The goal of national unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the
                        earlier Muromachi period was widely shared by the multitude of autonomous daimyō during the
                        Sengoku period. Oda Nobunaga was the first for whom this goal seemed attainable. Nobunaga had
                        gained control over most of Honshu before his death during the 1582 Honnō-ji incident, a coup
                        attempt executed by Nobunaga's vassal, Akechi Mitsuhide.

                        <br>
                        Nobunaga's successful subjugation of much of Honshu enabled the later successes of his allies
                        Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu toward the goal of national unification by subjugating local
                        daimyō under a hereditary shogunate, which was ultimately accomplished in 1603 when Ieyasu (The
                        Third Great Unifier of Japan) was granted the title of Shogun by Emperor Go-Yōzei following the
                        successful Sekigahara Campaign of 1600. The nature of the succession of power through the three
                        daimyō is reflected in a well-known
